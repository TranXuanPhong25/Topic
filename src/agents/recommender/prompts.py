Diagnosis: Acute Viral Pharyngitis (Common Cold), Severity: LOW

```markdown
## Treatment Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Rest** - Allow your body to fight the infection. Take time off work/school if possible.
2. **Hydrate** - Drink 8-10 glasses of water daily to thin mucus and prevent dehydration.

### Self-Care Measures
- **Rest**: Get 8-10 hours of sleep per night. Avoid strenuous activity for 3-5 days.
- **Hydration**: Warm liquids (tea, broth) soothe throat. Avoid alcohol and caffeine.
- **Nutrition**: Light, nutritious meals. Warm soup is beneficial. Avoid dairy if mucus is thick.
- **Pain Management**: 
  - Acetaminophen (Tylenol): 650mg every 6 hours for fever/pain
  - Ibuprofen (Advil): 400mg every 6 hours (alternative to acetaminophen)
  - Throat lozenges or warm salt water gargle (1/2 tsp salt in 8oz warm water)

### Lifestyle Adjustments
- Avoid smoking and secondhand smoke (irritates throat)
- Use humidifier in bedroom for moisture
- Wash hands frequently to prevent spread
- Stay home until fever-free for 24 hours

### Monitoring
Watch for these symptoms:
- ⚠️ **Fever >103°F or lasting >3 days** - Contact doctor
- ⚠️ **Difficulty breathing or swallowing** - Seek immediate care
- ⚠️ **No improvement after 7 days** - Schedule appointment
- ⚠️ **Severe headache or neck stiffness** - Seek immediate evaluation

### Follow-Up
- **Timeline**: No routine follow-up needed if improving
- **Expected Improvement**: Should feel better in 5-7 days
- **Return if**: Symptoms worsen, new symptoms develop, or no improvement after 1 week

### Additional Notes
- This is likely viral and antibiotics won't help
- Most contagious during first 2-3 days
- Cover coughs/sneezes to prevent spread to others
- Consider flu shot next season for prevention
